#  reliance mall Customer-Segmentation-and-Prediction-Python-
Customer Segmentation and Prediction using Python. The project includes data cleaning, EDA, clustering to segment customers based on behavior, and a predictive model to estimate future outcomes, supporting data-driven marketing and business development
# Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior and predicting future buying patterns using Python. The objective is to understand customer groups, analyze behavior patterns, and support data-driven marketing and business decisions.
# Objective
Perform customer segmentation using historical purchase data
Build a predictive model to estimate future customer purchases
Generate actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies
# Data Sources
The dataset includes customer-level data such as:
  Demographics
  Purchase history
  Product preferences
data is extracted and prepared for analysis using SQL and Python.
# Tasks Performed

Handled missing values
Removed duplicate records
Transformed variables into usable formats

2. Feature Engineering
Created new features such as:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
Average Order Value (AOV)
Purchase frequency

3. Customer Segmentation
Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into groups such as:
High-value customers
Low-value customers
Frequent buyers

4. Predictive Modeling
Built a predictive model (Linear Regression / Decision Tree)
Used historical data to predict future purchases

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using:
Accuracy
Precision

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer analytics workflow, covering data cleaning, feature engineering, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling using Python. The analysis reveals distinct customer groups and provides insights into purchasing behavior, enabling more targeted and data-driven marketing strategies. Overall, the project highlights practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and business-focused decision support.
